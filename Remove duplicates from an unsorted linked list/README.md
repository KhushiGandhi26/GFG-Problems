Given an unsorted linked list of N nodes. The task is to remove duplicate elements from this unsorted Linked List. When a value appears in multiple nodes, the node which appeared first should be kept, all others duplicates are to be removed.

Input:

N = 4

value[] = {5,2,2,4}

Output: 5 2 4

Explanation:Given linked list elements are
5->2->2->4, in which 2 is repeated only.
So, we will delete the extra repeated
elements 2 from the linked list and the
resultant linked list will contain 5->2->4
